How to compile and install Cygne/SDL:
-------------------------------------

1. Requirements

Cygne/SDL compiles and is tested with the following operating systems :

- BeOS R5 (Make sure you get the latest GCC package from BeBits.com)
- GNU/Linux
- FreeBSD
- Windows 9x/NT/ME/2K/XP (Use Cygwin or Mingw32 for compilation)

Make sure you've got GCC 2.95.2 or higher for compilation (check using gcc -v).
Other operating i386 systems which use GCC will probably work, please let us 
know which operating systems compiles Cygne/SDL and allows you to run Cygne/SDL
Feel free to e-mail your Makefile so that it can be included in future releases.

Cygne/SDL depends on the following libraries :

- Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) 1.2.3 or higher (http://www.libsdl.org)
- ZLIB compression library for unpacking ZIP/GZIP files (http://www.zlib.org)

2. First thing to check.

in the src/Makefiles you can find a couple of Makefiles for compilation using
GCC and GNU Make. Copy the desired Makefile.systemname to the /src directory
and rename it to Makefile. First edit the Makefile with your favorite editor
to set some libraries and includes correctly (read the comment!).

Besides a Makefile, you can also find a Cygne-SDL.dev file. This is a Dev C++
development suite project file (available for Linux and WIN32) and can be used
to compile Cygne/SDL using Dev C++.

3. Compilation.

After changing the Makefile with the correct settings, simply type the follwing
command : 'make'

This should compile Cygne/SDL correctly and provide you a binary called cygne
(or cygne.exe on WIN32 systems). 

4. Installation.

Not automated yet. Just copy or move the files to your desired location. 


That's it! Cygne/SDL is now compiled for your system and should allow you to
play those cool Wonderswan (Colour) emulator.
