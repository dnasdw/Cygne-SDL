Wish list for the Cygne/SDL development branch:

     - Automatic configure script;
     - OpenGL renderer;
     - Joystick/Joypad support;
     - Expanded rendering support;
     - CVS website :)

A short list, more should come in the list when Cygne/SDL is released and had
some more releases in the future.
