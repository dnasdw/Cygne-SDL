DISCLAIMER:

The use of this software is entirely at your own risk. The developers can't be
held responsible for damage done to your hard- and/or software.

This emulator requires ROM images for use. The use of ROM images from commercial
Wonderswan (Colour) games are allowed as long as you own the original cartridge.
The use of pirated or illegally obtained ROM's is prohibited and is a act of
piracy and illegal by law in certain countries. WE DO NOT SUPPORT PIRACY.


1. What is Cygne/SDL?

Originally Cygne was developed by Dox as a Bandai Wonderswan (Colour) emulator
for Windows systems. From version 2.1 Dox decided to release the Windows sources
to the public in GPL form which allows others to use the source and hack it :)

Cygne/SDL is a Cygne port using the Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) library which
is available at http://www.libsdl.org. If you want to know what SDL is, please
see the next topic. Cygne/SDL is the port for all Operating Systems which allows
you to use the SDL library. Currently Cygne/SDL has been succesfully compiled
on BeOS (Release 5), Linux (Debian 2.2r4), FreeBSD (4.4) and WIN32 systems
using the GNU C/C++ (GCC) compiler, SDL 1.2.3 and zlib 1.3 library.

Cygne/SDL is released as OpenSource under the GPL license. It uses code from the
orignal Cygne (allthough a bit modified), code from the MAME NEC CPU core as
well as portions from several SDLemu emulation projects. Anybody may hack the
current sourcecode if they like or can make additional changes into it.

Feel free to send contributions of your code to sdlemu@ngemu.com. The latest
sources will become available on http://sdlemu.ngemu.com. A forum for Cygne/SDL 
can be found on http://sdlemu.ngemu.com/phpBB2. A CVS server should come soon.

2. What is SDL?

The Simple Directmedia Layer library, or SDL for short, is a multimedia library
designed for graphics (software, YUV Overlay, OpenGL), input handling, sound
and other multimedia aspects. Currently it's available for several platforms
like BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, WIN32, PSX, etc. This means that most code
which use SDL is highly portable and could compile on other platforms.

For more information about SDL I should advice you to set your internet browser
to the SDL website : http://www.libsdl.org.

3. What is a Wonderswan?

The Wonderswan and/or Wonderswan Colour is a handheld device manufactered by
Bandai and is quite a hit in the land of the rising sun (read : Japan). Most
games are developed in Japanese but a handfull are developed in the English
language (allthough they are very hard to get). There are a bunch of games
available but those are not widely available outside of Japan. You should 
contact your local gamestore/consolestor which has import or use the internet 
and browse around for getting the handheld and/or games, that's the best option
to get a Wonderswan (Colour) or it's games.

The original Wonderswan provided Monochrome graphics like the Nintendo's Gameboy
but were more advanced. Somewhere in 2000/2001 Bandai released a Colour version
of it's handheld which had Nintendo GBA like graphics and features. Nowadays
games are hardly developed but sometimes a new one pops up. Especially the serie
Final Fantasy has some very impressive graphics and sound which shows of the
handheld.

4. Enough allready, how can I use Cygne/SDL!!?!?!

Ok, make sure you've got an OS with the GNU C/C++ compiler setup. We recommend
version 2.95.2 or above (GCC 3.0 has *NOT* been tested!). 2nd, make sure you've
setup SDL multimedia and the ZLIB compression library accordingly. If that's
done, follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.

Supported/Tested Operating Systems known to compile cleanly on:

- BeOS R5 with updated GCC;
- GNU/Linux with kernel 2.2.x or higher;
- FreeBSD 4.x;
- Win32 (All systems from Windows 95 supported)

WIN32, to compile Cygne/SDL I would recommend the Cygwin or Mingw32 GCC compiler
suite for WIN32 systems. Visual C++ is not yet supported but could work.

After compilation you can simply run cygne from a commandline prompt. With the
option 'cygne -h' you'll recieve a list with the switches supported. Normally
you would do 'cygne romfile.wsc' to startup Cygne/SDL with the desired ROM 
image. See the explanation in the next section for ROM images.

5. ROM Images?

Ok, for use with this emulator you need binary dumps of the original game-
cartridges or Public Domain games/demo's. These binary dumps are called ROM's
or ROM images. The use of ROM images is allowed as long as you own the orignal
game. If not, this is a act of piracy which hurts the gaming/emulation community
as well as the developers of Cygne and/or Cygne/SDL.

Several authors have been developing Public Domain games and/or demo's to show
off there programming skills. These ROM images are widely available on the
internet. Using google you should find some to work with Cygne/SDL. The game
WonderSnake is part of this source package (look in /WonderSnake) and was 
originally part of the Cygne WIN32 distribution. So you can use Cygne/SDL right
away :) For other Public Domain ROM images browse to http://www.pdroms.com.

BTW, ROM images may be compressed with ZIP or GZIP compression. This is 
supported and should work with out problems.

When a game produces strange result, try setting the Cycles/Line to a new 
setting using the 1 through 4 keys on your keyboard. See the next topic about
keyboard layouts. Overall, most games should work but some might not work
correctly or not at all! Keep in mind it's still emulation :)

6. Keyboard settings

To use the several ROM images you surely need to know how to control Cygne/SDL
so it acts like a Wonderswan (Colour). Here are the keyboard settings, they
are based upon Cygne's default keyboard layout :

----------------------------------------------------------

7. Finding Bugs/Contributions?

Did you find bugs or do you want to make contributions? Feel free to send them
to sdlemu@ngemu.com so that they can be solved/implented in the next source
release. Atm no CVS is running for Cygne/SDL but one is in the planning. 

Anyone who has features, ideas to add to the SDL version should send them here 
sdlemu@ngemu.com, full recognition will be given for any features added. 

Bugs can also be submitted on the SDLemu forum : http://sdlemu.ngemu.com/phpBB2.

8. Contact information.

The latest version of Cygne/SDL will always be available at the SDLemu website.
You can find it at http://sdlemu.ngemu.com. 

Contacting us is the easiest using e-mail and by sending it to sdlemu@ngemu.com.
The other way is using the forum (the link is provided at the SDLemu website).

Possibly a CVS server as well as a mailinglist could arrive soon :)

Lame messages like ROM requests or why doesn't game xxx run will not be 
awnsered.

9. Overall

Have phun with this release!
